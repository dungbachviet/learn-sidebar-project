# Learn Sidebar Web Project through re-coding from scratch
Learning a sidebar-web-project through re-coding it from scratch. This way is very efficient to understand all concepts related web/bootstraps.

I've learned based on a sidebar project using Bootstraps at [here](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar).
I chose index4.html with its .css file to re-code again: Partially collapsing static Bootstrap sidebar.
Thank the author a lot for your great website that helps me to learn Bootstrap as well as website components quite well !!!
